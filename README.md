# About Me

hi. I’m prerna — senior at KIIT.

Builder of things that run (mostly) in browsers.

I like web development because it's the perfect mix of creativity and chaos. One moment I’m designing clean UI, the next I’m in a 3-hour war with CSS specificity and some ghost z-index.

I experiment with new tech stacks not because I need them, but because I have commitment issues with frameworks. If it compiles, I’ll try it. If it breaks, I’ll pretend it was a learning experience.

Currently balancing coursework, side projects, and the existential dread of "what's next?"  
**(Also: actively looking for frontend/product engineering roles — open to full-time starting 2025.)**
